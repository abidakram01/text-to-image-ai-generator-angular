## ⚙️ Configuration

If you're using an external API (like Replicate or Stability.ai), configure it like so:

```ts
// src/environments/environment.ts
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiKey: 'your-secret-api-key'
};
```

**Note**: Never commit your API keys to GitHub. Use Angular environments or environment variables with proper security.
